## General Conclusion
1. A total of 818 books were published after January 1, 2000. This information helps us understand the amount of book content available for analysis.

2. All books in the source data have up to 1120 reviews, which indicates the diversity of user opinions. The average book rating ranges from 1.5 to 5.0, which allows us to evaluate the quality and popularity of books in the database.

3. When analyzing publishers that published books thicker than 50 pages, the largest number of such books was published by Penguin Books - 42 books. This indicates significant activity of the publisher in this area.

4. When looking at the authors with the highest average book ratings (counting only books with 50 or more ratings), we found that J.K. Rowling/Mary GrandPr√© has the highest average book rating of 4.28. This highlights the popularity and quality of their work among readers.

5. On average, active users write about 24 reviews. If we only count users who have given more than 48 ratings, we can conclude that every active user writes a review for every second book they rate. This indicates the high activity and interest of this group of users in evaluating and discussing books.
